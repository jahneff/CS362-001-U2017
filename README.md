This is my repository for CS362, otherwise known as Software Engineering 2. In this class, students are given programs that we need to analyze for bugs. Using Cobertura, a "free code coverage utility," students designed test suites in an attempt to maximize coverage of these programs. Starting with finding bugs in files, we progressed into writing static test suites, and then dynamic ones.
