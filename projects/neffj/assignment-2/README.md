CS362-001-U2017 Assignment-2 

Due date is Sunday, July 23th at 11:59pm (No late submissions will be accepted)

The goals of this assignment are: (a) to learn how to manually create a test suite; and (b) to learn how
to use a Cobertura code coverage tool in order to assess the comprehensiveness of a test suite.

The code being tested in this assignment is a calendar application consisting of several files. These files are found in Calendar/src/main/java/calendar. The goal of the assignment is to go over 75% line coverage for Appt.java, CalDay.java, and TimeTableTest.java. I created three test suites in Calendar/src/test/java/calendar that provide coverage > 75%. Their aim is to execute as many code paths as possible.
